# ⚛️ React Calculator – GitHub Workshop Instructions  

---
A **fork** in GitHub creates a copy of someone else's repository in your account. It’s used to:

* Contribute to open source by making changes and submitting pull requests
* Experiment without affecting the original project
* Customise or learn from existing code
* Work independently without needing permission

It's like cloning a project to make it your version.


### 🔧 Step 1: Fork & Clone

- Go to: [https://github.com/MiniduOshan/React-Calculator](https://github.com/MiniduOshan/React-Calculator)
- Click **Fork** to create your copy
- Clone it using GitHub Desktop or terminal
- Open the project in your IDE (e.g., VS Code)

---

### ⚙️ Step 2: Create a React App Using Vite

In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-calculator -- --template react
```
You can use whatever name for the app you like (e.g., my-calculator, calculator, etc.)

Then install dependencies:

```bash
cd my-calculator
npm install
```

---

### 🧩 Step 3: Replace Code Files

- From the forked repo, copy `App.jsx` and `App.css`
- Replace the corresponding files in your Vite app under `src/`

---

### 🧪 Step 4: Run & Test the App

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Test all buttons
- Check design accuracy

---

### 🚀 Step 5: Push Your Code to GitHub

- Copy the updated files back to your forked repo folder
- Commit and push your changes

---

### 🔁 Step 6: Submit a Pull Request

- Go to your forked GitHub repo
- Click **"Contribute → Open Pull Request"**
- Add a title like: `Completed React Calculator`
- Write a short description

---

### 🎉 You're Done!

After your pull request is reviewed and accepted, you’ll be listed as a **contributor**. Great job!
